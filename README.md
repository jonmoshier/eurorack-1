Guidelines for derivative works
===============================

**Mutable Instruments is a registered trademark.**

The name "Mutable Instruments" should not be used on any of the derivative works you create from these files.

We do not recommend you to keep the original name of the Mutable Instruments module for your derivative works.

For example, your 5U adaptation of Mutable Instruments Clouds can be called "Foobar Modular - Particle Generator".
